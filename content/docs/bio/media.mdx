## Display Options

### Open by Default

- **Open**: Embed loads and displays immediately - best for key content, but may slow page load.
- **Click to Open**: Shows a preview; users click to load - improves performance.

<Callout type="info">
  Use "Click to Open" for multiple embeds to boost performance and let users
  choose what to load.
</Callout>

## Technical Considerations

### Embed Limitations

- **Platform restrictions**: Some platforms limit or block embedding
- **Privacy policies**: Embedded content may track user interactions
- **Content availability**: Embedded content depends on source platform uptime

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

- **Embed not displaying**: Check if the platform allows embedding
- **Broken links**: Verify the URL is correct and content still exists

#### URL Formatting

- **Use direct links**: Ensure URLs point directly to embeddable content
- **Check permissions**: Some content may be private or region-restricted
- **Update regularly**: Links may become outdated if source content moves

<Callout type="warn">
  Embedded content is subject to the source platform's terms of service and
  availability. Content may become unavailable if the source is removed or made
  private.
</Callout>
