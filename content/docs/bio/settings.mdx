Bio Settings control the fundamental aspects of your E-Z Bio page, including URLs, display information, and layout configuration.

## General Settings

### URL

This is the primary URL where your Bio will be accessible (e.g., `https://e-z.bio/aiden`).

<Callout type="info">
  **Standard users**: URLs must use only alphanumeric characters. Only **Premium
  users** can use any Unicode characters.
</Callout>

### Alias URL

Create a secondary URL that redirects to your main Bio URL (e.g., `https://e-z.bio/skrrrtt` â†’ main URL).

<Callout type="warn">
  This is a **Premium Feature** and requires a premium upgrade from the
  [store](https://store.e-z.gg).
</Callout>

### Page Title

The title that appears in browser tabs and bookmarks when users visit your Bio.

**Example**: If you set the title to "SKRRRTT", it will display in the browser tab as shown.

#### Animated Title Option

Enable this feature to make your title scroll horizontally, moving left 2 characters at a time and looping continuously.

### Display Name

The name that appears under your avatar on your Bio page. This is the primary identifier visitors will see.

### Description

Text displayed directly below your Display Name. Use this space for:

- Personal bio information
- Descriptors and interests
- Pronouns
- Status updates

#### Typing Description Options

- **Type Once**: Description appears letter by letter, then stays static
- **Loop Typing**: Description types out, deletes, and retypes continuously

## Layout Settings

### Layout Selection

Choose between two display styles:

1. **Container Layout**: All components contained within a large background container
2. **Distributed Layout**: Components use the Primary Color without a main container background

### Layout Order

Drag and drop interface to reorder the different sections of your Bio:

- Avatar section
- Description
- Social links
- Discord components
- Media embeds
- Custom sections

## Best Practices

- **Keep descriptions concise** but informative
- **Use animated features sparingly** to avoid overwhelming visitors
- **Test your layout** on different devices to ensure good mobile experience
