## Songs

Add background music to your Bio page with advanced audio controls.

### Features

- **Multiple uploads**: Upload one or more audio files
- **Random playback**: Multiple songs play in random order
- **Supported formats**: MP3, WAV, OGG, etc

### Audio Options

#### Autoplay Fix

Displays a customizable splash screen that users must click to enter your Bio. This is **highly recommended** because:

- Most browsers block autoplay until user interaction
- Improves user experience and compliance
- Customizable text (click the cogwheel to edit)

#### Use Background Video Audio

- Disables separate song functionality
- Uses audio track from uploaded background video
- Hides the audio player which can be annoying
