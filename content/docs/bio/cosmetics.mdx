Cosmetic Settings control the visual styling and aesthetic elements of your Bio page, allowing you to create a unique and personalized appearance.

## Color Settings

### Primary, Secondary, and Accent Colors

These three colors form the foundation of your Bio's color scheme and are used throughout various components:

- **Primary Color**: Main background elements and borders
- **Secondary Color**: Text and secondary elements
- **Accent Color**: Highlights, buttons, and interactive elements

<Callout type="info">
  The usage of these colors across components may not be immediately obvious.
  Each component uses these colors in different ways to maintain visual
  consistency.

### Icon Color

Specifically controls the color of social media icons and other iconographic elements when "Theme Coloured Icons" is enabled.
