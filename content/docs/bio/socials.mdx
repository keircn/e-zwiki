Social Settings allow you to connect your various online profiles and social media accounts to your Bio page, creating a centralized hub for your digital presence.

## Social Media Links

### Platform management

Add social media profiles and external links through a simple two-field system:

#### Platform Selection

Choose from an extensive dropdown menu featuring:

- All major social media platforms (X, Instagram, TikTok, etc.)
- Professional networks (LinkedIn, GitHub, Gitlab, etc.)
- Gaming platforms (Steam, Twitch, Discord, etc.)
- Creative platforms (Spotify, SoundCloud, DeviantArt, etc.)
- Communication apps (Telegram, WhatsApp, Snapchat, etc.)
- And many more options

#### Links

This field accepts two types of input with different behaviors:

**Full URLs**

- Input complete links (e.g., `https://x.com/username`)
- **Behavior**: Opens in a new tab when clicked
- **Best for**: Direct links to profiles or content

**Usernames/Handles**

- Input just the username (e.g., `@username` or `username`)
- **Behavior**: Copies the value to user's clipboard when clicked
- **Best for**: Platforms where direct linking isn't ideal or usernames span multiple platforms

## Discord Integration

### Discord Invite

Add Discord server invites as a dedicated component on your Bio page.

#### Features

- **Moveable component**: Can be repositioned using Layout Order settings
- **Custom styling**: Inherits your Bio's visual theme
- **Direct integration**: Users can join your Discord server directly from your Bio

#### Setup

Input your Discord server invite link (e.g., `discord.gg/servercode`) to display an embedded invite widget.

### Discord Presence

Display real-time Discord status information directly on your Bio page.

#### Live Information Displayed

- **Online status** (Online, Idle, Do Not Disturb, Offline)
- **Current activity** (Playing games, listening to music, custom status)
- **Profile information** synced from Discord
- **Real-time updates** without page refresh

#### Requirements

- **Discord account linking**: You should have done this when you created your account
- **Privacy settings**: Ensure Discord privacy settings allow status sharing
- **Active connection**: Discord must be running for real-time updates

## Organization and Management
