The Embed Editor lets you customize how your uploaded files appear when shared on platforms that support Open Graph embeds (like Discord, Twitter, and Slack).

## Embed Fields

| Field            | Description                                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sitename**     | The name displayed as the website source                    |
| **Sitename URL** | The URL users are directed to when clicking the sitename    |
| **Author**       | The author name displayed in the embed                      |
| **Author URL**   | The URL users are directed to when clicking the author name |
| **Title**        | The main title of the embed                                 |
| **Description**  | The description text shown below the title                  |

## Embed Color

Set a custom color for your embed's accent bar. This color appears as the left border on Discord embeds.

## Toggle Options

| Option           | Description                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Embeds**       | Enable or disable custom embeds entirely                                       |
| **Timestamp**    | Show the upload timestamp in the embed                                         |
| **Random Color** | Use a randomly generated color for each upload instead of your set embed color |

## Placeholders

You can use dynamic placeholders in your embed Title and Description fields. These will be automatically replaced with the relevant information when the file is shared.

| Placeholder        | Description                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `{size}`           | The file size of the upload         |
| `{username}`       | Your E-Z username                   |
| `{filename}`       | The name of the uploaded file       |
| `{uploads}`        | Your total upload count             |
| `{domain}`         | The domain the file is hosted on    |
| `{date}`           | The upload date                     |
| `{time}`           | The upload time                     |
| `{timestamp}`      | The full timestamp of the upload    |
| `{fakeurl}`        | A fake URL for display purposes     |
| `{customfilepath}` | Your custom file path if configured |
| `{storage}`        | Your current storage usage          |

**Example Usage:**

Setting your Title to `{filename} ({size})` would display something like:

> file.png (9.16 MB)

Setting your Description to `{uploads} days since grass has been touched` would display something like:

> 5525 days since grass has been touched

## Managing Embeds

- **Save Embed** - Save your current embed configuration
- **Add Embed** - Create additional embed presets

You can create multiple embed presets and switch between them. The embed selector at the bottom shows which embed you're currently editing (e.g., "Showing #1 of 1 embeds").
