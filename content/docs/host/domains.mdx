E-Z.host offers a wide variety of domains for your uploads. You can use any of the public domains available, or donate your own custom domain.

## Domains List

The Domains List shows all available domains you can use for your uploads. Each domain displays:

| Column    | Description                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**  | The domain name (e.g., `bruh.bar`)          |
| **Users** | Number of users currently using this domain |
| **Tags**  | Domain classification tags (see below)      |

### Domain Tags

| Tag          | Description                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Public**   | Available for all users to use           |
| **Official** | Owned and maintained by E-Z              |
| **Donated**  | Donated by a community member            |
| **Wildcard** | Supports subdomains (e.g., `i.bruh.bar`) |

## Donating a Domain

You can donate your own domain to E-Z.host for personal or public use.

### Requirements

- You must own the domain you're donating
- The domain must not already be in E-Z's domain list

### How to Donate

1. Enter your domain in the **Add Domain** field
2. Select your options:
   - **Private** - Only you can use this domain
   - **Subdomains** - Enable wildcard subdomain support
3. Click **Submit** to begin the donation process
4. After submission, you'll receive Cloudflare nameservers to configure

### Configuring Nameservers

E-Z uses the Cloudflare API to manage donated domains. After submitting your domain:

1. You'll be provided with E-Z's Cloudflare nameservers
2. Log in to your domain registrar (where you purchased the domain)
3. Find the nameserver settings for your domain
4. Replace your current nameservers with the ones provided by E-Z
5. Save your changes and wait for propagation (can take up to 48 hours)

<Callout type="warn">
  Your domain will not work until you update your nameservers to the ones
  provided by E-Z.
</Callout>

## Domain Expiration

Domains are removed manually from E-Z after they expire. It's your responsibility to keep your donated domain renewed.

### Checking Domain Expiration

To check if your domain is expired or about to expire:

1. Use a WHOIS lookup service like [who.is](https://who.is) or [whois.domaintools.com](https://whois.domaintools.com)
2. Search for your domain name
3. Look for the **Expiration Date** or **Registry Expiry Date** field

<Callout type="info">
  Set a reminder to renew your domain before it expires. Expired domains will
  stop working and may be removed from E-Z.
</Callout>

### What Happens When a Domain Expires

- Uploads using that domain will no longer be accessible via that URL
- The domain will be manually removed from E-Z's domain list
- Your uploads are not deleted - they can still be accessed via other domains you've configured
