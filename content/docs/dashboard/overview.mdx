## Invites

E-Z is a paid service, and most users will need to purchase an invite code to join the platform. Invite codes start at $3 USD and are available from the [Store](https://store.e-z.gg), with PayPal as the primary payment method. Alternative payment options, such as card and crypto, are also available through resellers listed on the Store page. Once you have an invite code, you can [register](https://e-z.gg/dash/register) your account.

Occasionally, we host **Invite Waves**, where every user receives an invite code to share with a friend ([Premium](/docs/account/premium) users receive two invites). These codes expire automatically after 7 days if unused. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ez) to stay updated on announcements and invite opportunities!

You can manage your invite codes and see who you've invited in the [Dashboard](https://e-z.gg/dash) under **Manage Invites**.

## Domains

E-Z Services has a plethora of public [Domains](https://e-z.gg/dash/domains) to choose from when uploading files, shortening links or creating pastes.
You can also donate your own custom domains to use with the services at no extra cost and can choose to make them public (anyone can use it) or private (only you can use it).
