E-Z provides a custom **Embed** editor that allows you to customize how your media is displayed when shared on platforms like Discord.

You can access the Embed settings in the [Dashboard](https://e-z.gg/dash/settings/embeds).

## Customizing Your Embed

Most of the settings are self-explanatory, but the main interesting feature is **Embed Placeholders**. These allow you to use variables in your embed that will be replaced with the actual values when the embed is generated.

### Available Embed Variables

The embed editor supports the following variables, which are dynamically replaced with values from your account or the uploaded image:

- `{size}` — The size of the image, displayed in KB or MB.
- `{username}` — Your account username.
- `{filename}` — The name of the uploaded file.
- `{uploads}` — The total number of uploads on your account.
- `{domain}` — The domain used for the upload.
- `{date}` — The current date.
- `{time}` — The current time.
- `{timestamp}` — The current timestamp (UTC).
- `{fakeurl}` — The fake URL (if enabled).
- `{customfilepath}` — The custom file path (if set).
- `{storage}` — The total storage used by your account.

### Example Embed Configuration

You can use these variables in your embed fields. For example:

  alt="Embed Example"
  className="mx-auto block max-h-xl rounded-lg border border-border shadow-sm"
/>

## Embed Fields

The embed editor provides several customizable fields that you can configure:

### Sitename
The sitename appears in the embed header. This field supports variables:
```
e-z.host
```

### Sitename URL
The URL associated with the sitename (e.g., `https://e-z.gg`).

### Author
Set the author field to display your username or custom text:
```
{username}
```

### Author URL
An optional URL link for the author field.

### Title
The main title of your embed. You can use variables to make it dynamic:
```
{filename}
```

### Description
The description provides additional context about your media:
```
Size: {size}
```

### Embed Color
Set a custom hex color for your embed's accent color. You can enter a hex code directly (e.g., `#1E90FF`) or leave it blank for a default color.

## Advanced Embed Features

### Toggle Options
The embed editor includes several toggle switches to control embed behavior:

#### Embeds
Enable or disable embed functionality entirely. When disabled, your uploads will not display rich embeds.

#### Timestamp
Add a timestamp to your embed to show when the file was uploaded. This appears at the bottom of the embed.

#### Random Color
When enabled, each embed will use a randomly generated color instead of your custom embed color. This adds variety to your uploads.

### Managing Multiple Embeds
You can create and manage multiple embed configurations:
- Use the **Save Embed** button to save your current configuration
- Use the **Add Embed** button to create a new embed preset
- Navigate between embeds using the pagination controls at the bottom
- The interface shows "Showing #1 of 1 embeds" to indicate your current position

### Preview
The left side of the editor shows a live preview of how your embed will appear, including:
- File information (filename, size, upload count, storage used)
- The actual embedded image or media
- How the embed styling will look when shared

### Creating Multiple Embed Presets
You can create different embed configurations for different types of content:
- One preset for images with detailed descriptions
- Another for quick file shares with minimal information
- Specialized presets for different platforms or audiences

## Troubleshooting

### Variables Not Displaying
If your variables aren't showing up correctly:
- Ensure you're using the correct syntax with curly braces
- Check that the variable name is spelled correctly
- Verify that the variable is supported (refer to the list above)
- Make sure it isn't cached by the platform you're sharing on

### Embed Not Appearing
If your embed isn't displaying on platforms like Discord:
- Ensure embed is enabled in your settings
- Check that the platform supports the embed format
- Verify your domain is not blocked by the platform
