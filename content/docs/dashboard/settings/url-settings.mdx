E-Z provides comprehensive **URL Settings** that allow you to customize how your upload URLs are structured and displayed when sharing files.

You can access the URL Settings in the [Dashboard](https://e-z.gg/dash/settings/url-settings).

## URL Structure Configuration

### Domain and Path Setup
The URL builder at the top allows you to construct your preferred URL format:

- **Subdomain**: Add a custom subdomain (e.g., `files`, `cdn`, `media`)
- **Domain**: Select from available domains (e.g., `hentai.expert`)
- **Path**: Add a custom path segment after the domain

**Example URL Structure:**
```
https://subdomain.arch-linux.fun/path/filename.ext
```

## URL Customization Options

### Long URL
When enabled, your filenames will use 16 characters instead of the default 8.

### Show Link
Controls whether the URL is displayed on platforms like Discord when embeds are not in use.

### Custom Filename
Allows you to specify custom characters for your filename instead of using the default random string. No longer works on Discord.

### Invis Filename
Makes the filename invisible or hidden in the URL structure, creating cleaner-looking links. No longer works on Discord.

### Fake URL
Generates fake or alternative URLs for your uploads, such as `https://google.com/filename.ext`. Only works on Discord.

### Emoji Filename
Replaces traditional filename characters with emojis. No longer works on Discord.

### Sus Filename
Enables the use of the `à¶ž` character in the filename.

### Random Domain
When enabled, choose a number of random domains and the backend will select one at random for each upload.

### Custom Webhook
Enable custom webhook functionality to receive notifications when files are uploaded. Useful for caching uploads on discord for faster propogation.

<Callout type="warning">
  Some features will no longer work on discord. Discord's markdown update made non-english characters in URLs not decode properly.
