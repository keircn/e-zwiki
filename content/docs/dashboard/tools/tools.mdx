## Uploader

The [Uploader](https://e-z.gg/dash/uploader) allows you to upload files to E-Z Services.
You can upload files up to 25mb in size (100mb for [Premium](/docs/account/premium) users).
Supported [MIME](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/MIME_types) types include `image/*`, `video/*`, `audio/*` and `application/*`.
You will receive a public URL to the uploaded file, which you can share with others.
This can be customized in the [URL Settings](/docs/settings/url-settings) section of the dashboard.

## Pastes

The [Pastes](https://e-z.gg/dash/pastes) tool allows you to create and share text/code snippets.
We support syntax highlighting for a variety of programming languages, making it easy to share code with others.
You can even upload files as pastes, which is useful for sharing large text files or code snippets.
Created pastes are stored indefinitely, so you can always come back later to edit, share or delete them at amy time.

## Shortener

The [Shortener](https://e-z.gg/dash/shortener) allows you to shorten long URLs into short, easy-to-share links.
The short links are random, but you can cusstomize the rest of the URL in the [URL Settings](/docs/settings/url-settings) section of the dashboard.
Short links are stored indefinitely, so you can always come back later to share or delete them at any time.

## ShareX

[ShareX](https://e-z.gg/dash/sharex) is a utility we swear by for uploading files, pastes and links to E-Z Services.
It allows you to take screenshots, upload files and share links with ease.
You can configure ShareX to use E-Z Services as your default upload destination, making it easy to share files and pastes with others.
You can also export a [ShareX](https://getsharex.com) config file in any of our tools to easily set up ShareX with E-Z Services.
