## Invites

Rarely, there will be an **Invite Wave**, where all users are given an invite code to share with a friend ([Premium](/docs/account/premium) users get 2 invites) but they automatically expire after 7 days of being unused so be sure to stay in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/ez) as to not miss any announcements!

You can find your invite codes in the [Dashboard](https://e-z.gg/dash) under the **Manage Invites** seection. You can also see which users you have invited in the past.

## Settings

Want to change how the URL looks for uploaded files? Want your own custom embed? Does an upload tool sound useful to you?
All these options can be found in the [Settings](https://e-z.gg/dash/settings) along with many other awesome features to make your experience as straightforward and valuable as possible.

## Domains

E-Z Services have a plethora of public [Domains](https://e-z.gg/dash/domains) to choose from when uploading files, shortening links or creating pastes. You can also donate your own custom domains to use with the services at no extra cost and can choose to make them public (anyone can use it) or private (only you can use it).
