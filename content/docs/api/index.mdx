## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:
```
https://api.e-z.host
```

## Authentication

All API requests must include your API key in the `key` header:

```http
key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

You can obtain your API key from your [E-Z Account Settings](https://e-z.gg/dash/account).

## Available Services

The E-Z.host API provides access to three main services:

- **File Upload** - Upload and host files with automatic Cloudflare CDN distribution
- **URL Shortener** - Create short, shareable links from long URLs
- **Paste Service** - Create text pastes with syntax highlighting support

## Rate Limiting

All endpoints enforce a rate limit of **3 requests per 15 seconds per API key**. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` error. Rate limit information is also provided in the response headers:

```
Ratelimit-Limit: 3
Ratelimit-Remaining: 2
Ratelimit-Reset: 13
```

## Error Handling

All API responses include a `success` field indicating whether the request was successful. If `success` is `false`, the response will include an error message:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "not enough rizz"
}
```

Common error codes:
- `400` - Bad Request (invalid parameters)
- `401` - Unauthorized (invalid or missing API key)
- `413` - Payload Too Large (file size exceeds limit)
- `429` - Too Many Requests (rate limit exceeded)
- `500` - Internal Server Error
